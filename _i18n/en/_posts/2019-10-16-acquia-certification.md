Program of certification from Acquia is an attempt to determine standards of knowledge and experience of working with Drupal. Based on passed exams by developer, employers can understand his level. Clients can be sure that they work with professionals. Computer programmers can compare own level with level of colleagues. And Acquia checks the number of certified developers in the agencies when they want to be their partners.

## Types of certificates

**There are main certificates that validate knowledge of Drupal:**
* **Acquia Certified Site Builder - D8** - is intended for professionals who build Drupal sites using core and contributed modules.
* **Acquia Certified Developer - D8** - aim of this exam is validation of skills and knowledge of Drupal developers in fundamental concepts of web development, site creation, front-end and back-end development.
* **Acquia Certified Front End Specialist - D8** - validation of skills and knowledge of Drupal developers in the area of front-end development.
* **Acquia Certified Back End Specialist - D8** - validates skills and knowledge of developers in the area of implementation of Drupal applications using custom code.

**Also there are certifications for Acquia products:**
* **Acquia Certified Cloud Pro** - checks knowledge and experience of work with hosting platform Acquia Cloud.
* **Acquia Certified Site Factory Pro** - checks knowledge and experience of work with multisite platform Acquia Cloud Site Factory.

Besides these there are also certifications for Drupal 7, but I think they aren’t actual anymore.

Everyone, who passed Acquia Certified Developer, Acquia Certified Front End Specialist and Acquia Certified Back End Specialist certifications, are granted honorary title **Grand Master**.
