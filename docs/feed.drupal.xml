            <title>Features of using the service container in tests in Drupal 9</title>
            
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you noticed that services are called through &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$this-&amp;gt;container-&amp;gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\Drupal::service()&lt;/code&gt; in Kernel and Functional tests. On the first glance it doesn’t matter - we receive a service in any case and tests work, but there are nuances. Let’s figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Using of class resolver for dependency injection in Drupal 9</title>
            
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider the case: there is a little class that is used in the module locally (for example in a hook) that uses service.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Never use patches based on merge/pull requests</title>
            
            <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a great feature that can be used after Drupal code migration into GitLab infrastructure - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/git/using-git-to-contribute-to-drupal/creating-issue-forks-and-merge-requests&quot;&gt;merge requests&lt;/a&gt;. It is more convenient than the old method when patches had to be created and uploaded on drupal.org to the task for a review. Everyone who already worked on GitHub with pull requests evaluated this approach.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Design patterns in Drupal 9</title>
            
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Drupal developers work with design patterns rarely because they mainly work in the formed environment. We use patterns every day, but we don’t even think about it. When you know design patterns you can simplify your communication with colleges - you can just tell the name of the pattern and everyone understands what you are talking about. Also you can use effective solutions instead of trying to invent your own things. Design patterns are the same for all programming languages but implementation differs. So you will find where to apply them in your career. By the way, questions about patterns are one of the most frequent during interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Standards in Drupal projects</title>
            
            <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s important to define standards that will be used on the Drupal project prior to the start of the project especially if the project is big. Thus everyone involved in the project will understand which rules should be respected during development and maintenance of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Module Views is one of the most popular modules on the Drupal sites. I think it is enabled on all sites built on Drupal. In this article I would like to describe issues with performance of Views that I’ve faced using this module and ways for optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Antibot vs Honeypot. What spam protector to prefer in Drupal</title>
            
            <description>&lt;p&gt;If there are forms for anonymous users on your site then sooner or later you will think about how to protect them against bots. It is tiringly to remove spam comments or irrelevant webform submissions manually.&lt;/p&gt;
