            <title>Never use patches based on merge/pull requests</title>
            
            <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a great feature that can be used after Drupal code migration into GitLab infrastructure - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/git/using-git-to-contribute-to-drupal/creating-issue-forks-and-merge-requests&quot;&gt;merge requests&lt;/a&gt;. It is more convenient than the old method when patches had to be created and uploaded on drupal.org to the task for a review. Everyone who already worked on GitHub with pull requests evaluated this approach.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Design patterns in Drupal 9</title>
            
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Drupal developers work with design patterns rarely because they mainly work in the formed environment. We use patterns every day, but we don’t even think about it. When you know design patterns you can simplify your communication with colleges - you can just tell the name of the pattern and everyone understands what you are talking about. Also you can use effective solutions instead of trying to invent your own things. Design patterns are the same for all programming languages but implementation differs. So you will find where to apply them in your career. By the way, questions about patterns are one of the most frequent during interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Standards in Drupal projects</title>
            
            <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s important to define standards that will be used on the Drupal project prior to the start of the project especially if the project is big. Thus everyone involved in the project will understand which rules should be respected during development and maintenance of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Drupal certification from Acquia</title>
            
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Program of certification from Acquia is an attempt to determine standards of knowledge and experience of working with Drupal. Based on passed exams by developer, employers can understand his level. Clients can be sure that they work with professionals. Computer programmers can compare own level with level of colleagues. And Acquia checks the number of certified developers in the agencies when they want to be their partners.&lt;/p&gt;
